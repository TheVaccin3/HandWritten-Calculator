# Hand Written Math Equation Calculator

This project is a ML model to take in a handwritten image of a math equation and either solve it for you, or check if the given answer is correct or not. 

Known bugs: 
1. the numbers 4 and 1, and the symbols +, -, are often misclassified. Solving this will require modification to the dataset and subsequent re-training. 
2. The clear button does not work. so entering multiple equations will require a restart of the application
3. Running the program requires multiple large pip dependancies. 

Please read the Final report in the repo to find the full details on this project.
